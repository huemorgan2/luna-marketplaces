"""plugin-voice — talk to Luna by voice in the browser.

ElevenLabs Agents handles the audio loop (mic, STT, TTS, barge-in) between the
browser and their edge; Luna stays the brain via an OpenAI-compatible bridge
route this plugin serves (see `bridge.py` / `routes.py`). Authored against
`luna_sdk` only.
